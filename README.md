# Predicting Customer Attrition in the Banking Industry

This project aims to develop predictive models to forecast customer attrition in the banking industry. By leveraging machine learning techniques and data analytics, the project seeks to provide actionable insights for banks to enhance customer retention strategies.


## Project Overview
The project includes the following key components:
- Data Collection: Obtained customer data from a leading banking institution.
- Data Preprocessing: Handled missing values, outliers, and encoded categorical variables.
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Analyzed customer demographics, transaction behavior, and account details.
- Model Development: Developed predictive models using machine learning algorithms such as logistic regression, random forest, XGBoost, and support vector machines (SVM).
- Model Evaluation: Evaluated model performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC.
- Ethical Considerations: Addressed data privacy, fairness, and bias considerations throughout the project.

## How to Use
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your_username/predicting-customer-attrition.git
   ```
   
2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Run the Jupyter Notebook `customer_attrition_prediction.ipynb` to explore the project and run the code.
